# About Me
## My Interests 
  1. One of my top Interests/Hobbies is the sport of bodybuilding. As a Marine Corps veteran, personal fitness was ingrained in me from the first day I stepped foot on the recuit depot at parris island,SC. From there, I developed a strong passion for pushing pass the limits of what I thought I was capable of, growing stong not only physically but also mentally. This resiliency allows me to tackle life's challenges, whether I was on the battlefield or lifting heavy weights. 
  2. Next on my list of top Intersts/Hobbies is race cars/trucks and maximizing their performance potentials.I have had a strong passion for racing since my early days as a teenager racing go-carts. As i got older, I enjoyed building cars for roadcourses.What really drives my passion is the blood, sweat, and tears of long nights of wrenching and testing performance upgrades that I have applied-Slapping on that new supercharger or dialing in the suspension to get maximum grip in and out of corners. There are very few things that compare to pushing a piece of engineering to it limits.
